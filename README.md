The purpose of the Ayoba API governance is to create a consistent approach to the development of an API across processes, standards, and guidelines while putting compliance mechanisms and measures in place.
API governance activities include planning the development of new APIs and updating current APIs and management of the individual APIs to ensure that service specification updates are consistent with our API best practices, operational principles and guidelines.
